BrainIAK Aperture paper

Please submit your notebooks for the Aperture paper here. Please do not uload any data here, just provide instructions on how to fetch the data for the notebook. We will eventually store all the data on Zenodo and provide the URL from Zenodo here.

We also plan to use this repo to provide an annotated bibliography for each method. You may create the annotated bibliography for the each method in a separate document.

The file structure we propose is as follows:

--root
  --notebooks
    --isc
    --srm 
    ...
  --annotated_bibliography
    --isc
    --srm
    ....
