Neurosci.* 29, 13992–14003. *Uses an encoding model to reconstruct color in a continuous space (including colors outside of the training set) and demonstrates how color is represented across a hierarchy of visual regions.  *

Inverted encoding models assay population-level stimulus representations, not single-unit neural tuning. *ENeuro* 5, 1–5. *Argues that inverted encoding models are most useful when using population-level stimulus representations across experimental manipulations to pointedly test psychological theories. *

The importance of considering model choices when interpreting results in computational neuroimaging. *ENeuro* 6, 1–11. *Clarifies the encoding model approach in the broader scope of computational models, reasserts its utility for addressing a class of psychological questions under carefully constructed experimental conditions, and acknowledges its important limitations.*
