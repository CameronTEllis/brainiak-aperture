*Describes the first implementation of our rt-cloud software framework in a closed-loop fMRI study which provided continuous neurofeedback based on a univariate ROI-based analysis.*

ANNE's GREEN EYES STUDY (couldn't find the citation for this study)

*Second implementation of our rtcloud framework, this time on a study which provided intermittent neurofeedback from an multivariate pattern classifier trained on an independent dataset ([Yeshurun et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797616682029)).*
