Bias in neural representational similarity analysis and a Bayesian method for reducing bias. *PLoS Computational Biology*, 15(5), e1006299. [link](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006299&rev=2) *This paper improves the earlier version of BRSA by additionally modeling the spatial noise correlation and marginalizing voxel-wise noise parameters. The paper also introduces group BRSA and the use of cross-validation to compare an estimated model against a null model, and further extends BRSA to task-signal decoding, using the estimated similarity structure as an empirical prior for estimating neural patterns.*
